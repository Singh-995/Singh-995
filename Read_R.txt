Goals 
Not the first time that I have write them down.
X-heloo how :Water
There will be a list similar to this that might 
have the same goals.

Reason I haven't progressed. I was worried to much 
about spending too much money and not liking the 
experience or feeling that I got out of it.

Just like today. I felt that I shouldnt have spend 
my time so lightlty. But then what I want. Its
usually to expensive or out of reach.
X-follow your heart: openly
I get that I dont understand much in sense of attraction 
but what can be done.
 
Priority is to get better and healthy with
better mind space.
X-Don't be shy:Ever
I don't want to travel much.

 Only thing that I can think of is getting better at
my career and being social.

Why I think that I didn't progressed:
>Didn't achieve the grades that I expected 
>Not able to get the required fame or recognition 
at college.
>No Gossip
>Awkward
>Why I felt like that.
>The issue is that I want to try those things 
but didn't have the courage to start following my 
path.

Trying to do too many things at one time.

What can be done?

>Get that experience back
>Don't be tense all the time
>Chill out 
>Practice.
>Spend money don't worry too much 
you have enough of it. Already spend like 15K just
for the three piece suit and pant.
>Make a schedule so that you can spend time 
 productive. Deadlines

PRoject>courses
Write down projects you will be doing and give yourself 
deadline for it.

courses > get online certificates and watch online vidoes 
that can help

Porn watching is an addiction and I made a habit out 
of it. If you want to quit it. Dont touch yourself 
down there even if you are horny especially 
when texting another person

Remember some lines that can be said as an opener

I will buy one book each week only if I spend enough 
time being productive

Reading one paper book each week
